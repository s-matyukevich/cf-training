### Inroduction

In this lesson we are going to install Cloud Foundry using BOSH. For more information about BOSH itself, please refer to the previous course level. 
Unlike the previous course level, we are not going to use fully featured BOSH Director, instead we will use [BOSH Lite](https://bosh.io/docs/bosh-lite.html) that has been allready deployed to your infrastructure by the training platform. The main thing that you need to understand about BOSH Lite is that it sumulates IaaS behaviour using containers, so we can deploy faster and use a single VM. In this course level is desinged to be non IaaS specific, bo BOSH Lite perfectly suits out needs.
