## Verify deployment

### 1. To verify your Cloud Foundry deployment, run smoke tests:
``` 
bosh run-errand smoke-tests
```

### 2. Login to Cloud Foundry to see that your deployment is successfully working:
```
cf login --skip-ssl-validation -a  https://api.bosh-lite.com -u admin -p {{ cat ~/cf-deployment/deployment-vars.yml | grep uaa_scim_users_admin_password | awk '{print $2}'  }}
```
Note that admin password was generated by BOSH CLI and was stored in `~/cf-deployment/deployment-vars.yml` file as `uaa_scim_users_admin_password` property.
