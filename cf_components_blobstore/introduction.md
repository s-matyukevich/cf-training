### Introduction

Now it is time to look deeper into Cloud Foundry internals. In the following series of lessons we are going to examine all major Cloud Foundry components. As a DevOps you probably don't need to fully understand the source code of all CF components, but you definetely need to understand from what components Cloud Foundry consists, how those components communicate with each other and what APIs they expose to the outside world, what configuration properties do they have and how you can trobleshoot any CF specific problem. Learning all of that is the purpose of the upcomming lessons. And we are going to start with a pretty simple component: Blobstore.
